Easy thermometer to DIY based on ESP8266, display LCD 16x2 with I2C, two sensors DS18B20 and resistor 4,7k Ohm
Whole project is basing on WWW page and LCD , so you can see the temperature on LCD or web page
DS18D20 is connected to 3.3v pin, ground and D4 for data. Power cable and data cable are connected together by resistor
LCD is connected to 5v, ground pin and SLC pin from LCD is connected to D1, and SDA to D2 pin (on ESP8266)
